/**
 * Returns a list of potential tabbable elements
 *
 * NOTE: This is only a close approximation. For example it doesn't take into account cases like when
 * elements are not visible. This cannot be worked out easily by just reading a property, but rather
 * necessitate runtime knowledge (computed styles, etc). We deal with these cases separately.
